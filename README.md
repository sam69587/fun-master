# ApiClientFun

Welcome!

This is a basic ruby gem scaffold to create a **client** for call to an existing API endpoint.

The API's you will need to call is located at:  https://blooming-savannah-20593.herokuapp.com/api/

returns their profile.

The api has two endpoints, responds with JSON, and is unauthenticated.

1) https://blooming-savannah-20593.herokuapp.com/api/users

Returns a list of users.

2) https://blooming-savannah-20593.herokuapp.com/api/users/{id}

Returns a specific user.

Zip up your code and send it along to the email instructed.

Have Fun!
